# text_word_stats
Simple program that gets text through stdin() and prints out the word count of each word. Written in Rust.

To use preferably have your text in a file in the root directory of the project (like where sample.txt is located).
Then run ```Get-Content sample.txt | cargo run``` (Powershell) and watch as the script prints out the number of occurances of each word sorted from greatest to least.
